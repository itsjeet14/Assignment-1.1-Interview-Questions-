                                                         Long Answer Type 
                                                    
1. What is the difference between a "for" loop and a "while" loop?
A "for" loop is typically used when you know exactly how many times the loop needs to be repeated. A "while" loop is typically used when you 
don't know how many times the loop needs to be repeated. A "while" loop repeats as long as its condition is true. For example, if a "while" loop 
says "while x == 5", then the line will execute as long as x equals five.

2. What is the Python syntax for a "for" loop?
The "for" loop is a programming construct that allows you to iterate over an arbitrary range of values, mapping them to the required actions.
It can be thought of as an extension of the mathematical notion of a "for" loop, which is defined as "a control structure that enables one to 
iterate (repeat) a process (such as counting or summing) while varying the process's start value (or its end point), step size, and/or direction."

- The syntax for Python for loops is:
for x in range(y): 
  do something

3. What are the advantages of using a "for" loop in Python?
A "for" loop is a type of loop that executes a set of instructions repeatedly. It uses the following syntax: for x in range(y): do something
This type of loop has the following properties:
•	For loops are good because they can make your code more readable and easier to follow.
•	They also make sure that certain instructions are executed at least one time.

4. What are the disadvantages of using a "for" loop in Python?
The for-loop is one of the most basic constructs in programming. However, this construct has its own disadvantages.
•	If you don't know the upper-bound of your loop, you have to keep track of it by hand or break out of your loop early.
•	You can't use a break statement to escape from a nested loop.

5. How can I use a break statement in my Python "for" loops?
A break statement can be used to terminate a loop. It is often used when the programmer needs to stop iterating through the data and instead 
go back to checking for other conditions.

6. what is the difference between the "continue" and "break" statements in Python?
The "break" statement terminates the loop that contains it. The program immediately moves to the code section that is in the outer scope of the loop.
The "continue" statement skips the rest of the code of the current iteration and move to the next iteration.
